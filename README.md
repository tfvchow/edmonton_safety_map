# Edmonton Safety Map

This project shows Edmonton Police Service incident data on an interactive map. Use it to explore which communities experience more crime and filter by different categories or types.

Data is available from 2022 through 2025. The 2025 data only goes up to **May 28**.

### How the map is prepared

> According to EPS, "To anonymize the location of the incident the point on the map is relocated to the closest intersection to where they occurred and should be considered approximate." This means each row in the EPS dataset marks only an approximate spot.
>
> For each data point, the related community is determined using the city's [neighbourhood boundaries](https://data.edmonton.ca/dataset/Neighbourhood-Boundaries-2019/xu6q-xcmj/about_data).
