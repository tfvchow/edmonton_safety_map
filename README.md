# Edmonton Safety Map

This project shows Edmonton Police Service (EPS) incident data on an interactive map. Use it to explore where incidents were reported and filter by different categories or types. The counts shown are the number of recorded incidents only and do not measure crime rates. EPS explains, "Occurrences in your neighbourhood can be both criminal and non-criminal. Not all police activity is in response to crime. Regardless of where you live, the potential for police activity exists."

Data is available from 2022 through 2025. The 2025 data only goes up to **May 28**.

### How the map is prepared

> According to EPS, "To anonymize the location of the incident the point on the map is relocated to the closest intersection to where they occurred and should be considered approximate." This means each row in the EPS dataset marks only an approximate spot.
>
> For each data point, the related community is determined using the city's [neighbourhood boundaries](https://data.edmonton.ca/dataset/Neighbourhood-Boundaries-2019/xu6q-xcmj/about_data).

### Data and terms of use

Both the incident data and the neighbourhood boundaries are published as open datasets. This project is a fair use of those materials. See the [Edmonton Police Service Terms and Conditions of Use](https://eps1.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/4fd51d8089234b3699a3f8ef7572c427/data) and the [City of Edmonton Open Data Terms of Use](https://data.edmonton.ca/stories/s/City-of-Edmonton-Open-Data-Terms-of-Use/msh8-if28/) for details.
